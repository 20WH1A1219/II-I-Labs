# Experiment 6
## Aim of Experiment
#### Write a C++ program to use scope resolution operator. Display the various values of the same variables declared at different scope levels.
### Step by Step Procedure of the experiment
Step 1. Include the header files(iostream.h and conio.h)

Step 2. Create class(circle) with the following members as public members,radius as data member area() as member function.

Step 3. Implement all member functions with their respective code(Using scope resolution).

Step 4. Initialize the num value to 100 outside the member class.

Step 5. Create a main() method

Step 6. Create an object (c) of the above class inside the main() method.

Step 7. Initialize the num value to 500 inside the main class.

Step 8. Display num with scope resolution and without scope resolution to know the difference.

Step 9. Call the member function area().

Step 10. return 0 to exit from the program execution.
